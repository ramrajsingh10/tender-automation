# Pre-Chunk Strategy\n\n## Must Have\n- Catalogue common heading patterns, numbering styles, and annexure markers across sample tenders.\n- Prototype a Python-based splitter (e.g., using pypdf) to split PDFs at heading boundaries before ingestion.\n- Store each logical section as a separate chunk and feed the smaller files into Vertex RAG import.\n- Track section metadata (tender ID, heading) so the validator can see which section produced a RagFile.\n\n## Should Have\n- Provide a CLI script (scripts/prechunk_rag.py) to rerun ingestion with pre-chunked pieces and log section counts.\n- Add unit tests that validate heading detection on sample PDFs.\n- Integrate splitter into the ingest worker, falling back to original flow on failure.\n\n## Could Have\n- Persist section headers alongside RagFile metadata for validation UI.\n- Write chunked sections back to GCS for auditing.\n- Allow playbook queries to target specific section IDs.\n\n## Won't Have (for now)\n- Full OCR/document-AI pipeline (out of scope for MVP).\n
